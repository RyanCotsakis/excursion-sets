### Functions for Analyzing Binary and Continuous Fields in R

This repository contains a set of functions for analyzing binary and continuous fields in R. The functions can be used for a variety of applications, including image processing, data analysis, and statistical inference.

### Demos
- `demos/consistency_of_perimeter_estimate.R` recreates Figures 7 and 9 in Cotsakis et al. (2022), and shows how to estimate the perimeter of pixelated excursion sets of 2D anisotropic random fields.
- `demos/effect_of_anisotropy_on_perimeter_estimate.R` recreates Figure 6 in Cotsakis et al. (2022)
