### Functions for Analyzing Binary and Continuous Fields in R

This repository contains a set of functions for analyzing binary and continuous fields in R. The functions can be used for a variety of applications, including image processing, data analysis, and statistical inference.

### Demos
- `demos/consistency_of_perimeter_estimate.R` recreates Figure 7 in Cotsakis et al. (2022), and shows how to estimate the perimeter of pixelated excursion sets of 2D anisotropic random fields.

### References
The functions in this repository are based on research by Ryan Cotsakis, Elena Di Bernardino, and Thomas Opitz. The following references are used to construct the functions:
